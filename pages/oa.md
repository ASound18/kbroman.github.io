title: Toward an Open Access Policy for UW-Madison
---

I am the 2014&ndash;2015 Chair of the
[University Library Committee](https://www.library.wisc.edu/about/university-library-committee/)
at the [University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](http://www.wisc.edu).
One of the main things I would like to achieve in this role is to get
UW-Madison to enact an Open Access Policy, through which university
researchers would give UW-Madison the right to freely distribute
pre-prints of all published manuscripts.

We have formed a working group to develop an open access
policy. ([See its instructions](../assets/OAWG_Charge_112014pdf.pdf)
from
[Edward Van Gemert](http://www.library.wisc.edu/about/directory/staff/Edward-Van-Gemert/),
Vice Provost for Libraries and University Librarian.)

Here I provide provide links to some resources related to the topic.
