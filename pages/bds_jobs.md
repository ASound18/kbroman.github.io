title: Job opportunities in biomedical data science
---

The
[Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu)
at UW-Madison is developing a proposal for a new PhD program in
Biomedical Data Science. As part of the proposal, we need to
demonstrate the need for the program.

Part of this is easy: huge increase is size and complexity of
biomedical data (from genomics-type assays, plus electronic health
records) and increased reliance on such data in medical decisions and
for health care policy. Also, there have been numerous calls for
training in biostatistics and biomedical informatics.

But we are also asked to provide data on employment opportunities for
graduates of the program. This seems a bit more tricky. My main
concern is the need to separate data science generally (which is
mostly non-biomedical; for example, tech and finance) from biomedical
data science in particular.

This page is a list of possible evidence we might present.

Terms to consider:

- biomedical data scientist
- biostatistician
- biomedical informatics
- computational biologist
- bioinformatics
- data scientist
- statistician
